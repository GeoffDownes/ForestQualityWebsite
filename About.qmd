## Background

After leaving CSIRO in 2012 Geoff Downes established FQ as a Research, Development and Extension company with a view to develop and supply wood quality assessment services to the forest industry. Through many years of working with industry and involvement in non-destructive wood property measurement (SilviScan, near infra red spectroscopy (NIR), standing tree and log acoustics) the need was still there for an assessment approach that was sufficiently low cost to allow broad-scale, routine application in forest evaluation. Since its inception, FQ has offered routine NIR analytical services, investing in the establishment of a Bruker MPA instrument utlising well-tested calibrations for the prediction of kraft pulk yield and cellulose content in plantation eucalypts. Since then we have undertaken the evaluation of over 30 thousand wood meal samples for Australian eucalypt growers and this data has provided an important input into the eucalypt breeding programmes of our industry.

In 2015 the opportunity arose to explore the application of resistance drilling to the estimation of softwood log quality through relating data to log stiffness (MOE), an important indicator of resultant board properties post processing. Resistance drilling (IML PD series power drills) allows the measurement of a standing tree with high resolution data describing average wood properties (primarily basic density) and their radial patterns of variation, taking only seconds to sample a tree. To facilitate its commercial use, we developed a web-based processing platform (e.g <https://forestquality.shinyapps.io/OpenAccess/>) that allowed the drill data to be uploaded, processed and key metrics of growth (over and under bark diameters) and wood properties (basic density and stiffness) to be predicted.

After multiple studies developing sampling protocols and establishing the accuracy, precision and robustness of the measures, resistance drilling is rapidly establishing itself as a routine commercial operation, contributing to the communication between growers and processors of logs regarding quality attributes based on density and stiffness.

Our IP and software is being utilised by many softwood growers and sawmill processors across Australia, as well as companies in Indonesia, China, South Africa, Brazil and New Zealand.
