    "text": "Resi Sampling in a radiata pine plantation in New Zealand\nTimber production via plantation forestry is a relatively slow process that transcends multiple cycles of shifts in government policy that affect its efficiency, focus and profitability. Over recent decades general economic policy paradigms have favoured the dis-aggregation of the forest supply chain into, broadly speaking, growers, processors and manufacturers. A consequence of this has been the financial incentive for growers to shorten rotation lengths, enhancing the return on investment by a primary focus on improved stem diameter and volume growth rates.\nThe variation in plantation softwood wood properties within the stem has been a major focus of research [1–3] over decades with a well established pattern of increasing basic density from pith to bark, together with the associated decrease in microfibril angle [4,5], resulting in a pattern of radial improvement in structural wood quality. In general terms this is understood in terms of juvenile (low quality) wood near the pith and mature (better quality) wood towards the bark. Consequently a reduction in rotation length, as optimal log diameters are achieved at earlier ages, results in an increase in the proportion of lower quality juvenile wood in logs [6,7]. Longitudinal variation in log properties, which is markedly effected by the radial variation patterns, has also been studied extensively [8–12], having the advantage that variation can more easily be partitioned into logs of varying quality according to their within-stem position. Understanding and quantifying the effects of site, rotation length and management on these longitudinal patterns of wood property change can assist the valuation of stands by basing value on additional stem features as well as volume and form.\nWood property assessment of softwood plantations in Australia is increasingly becoming a routine operation [13] as growers endeavour to understand the variability in value across their estates and gain commercial advantage from supplying logs of known properties to their customers. Typically basic density assessments via pilodyn [14] or outerwood increment coring has been the common approach [15]. However this has been too expensive for wide spread commercial.\nResistance drilling, combined with web-based processing of traces (e.g. https://forestquality.shinyapps.io/OpenAccess/), has increasingly been utilised by growers in Australia, as research has demonstrated the low-cost, precision and accuracy of the various metrics produced (under and over-bark diameter, basic density, predicted stiffness and acoustic wave velocity) [13,16,17]. The focus of this effort has been to estimate or predict log stiffness, typically using basic density as a surrogate, but increasingly utilising regression models that include additional metrics extracted from the Resi trace related to AWV variance as assessed suing the FibreGen HM200 instrument [18].",

    "text": "Forestry Quality was established in 2012 as spin-off from the CRC Forestry (https://www.eoas.info/biogs/A002315b.htm) which operated from 2005 to 2013. The focus was a Research, Development and Extension company that would take some of the wood quality assessment technology developed within the CRC to continue to provide these to the forest industry. Through many years of working with industry and involvement in non-destructive wood property measurement (SilviScan, near infra red spectroscopy (NIRS), standing tree and log acoustics) the need was still there for an assessment approach that was sufficiently low cost to allow broad-scale, routine application in forest evaluation.\nSince its inception, FQ has offered routine NIR analytical services, investing in the establishment of an NIR analytical laboratory utilising well-tested calibrations for the prediction of Kraft pulp yield and cellulose content in plantation eucalypts. Since 2012 we have undertaken the evaluation of over 30 thousand wood meal samples for Australian eucalypt growers and this data has provided an important input into the eucalypt breeding programmes of our industry, as well as providing detailed information on how pulp yield and basic density vary across some of the plantation eucalypt estate.\nIn 2015 the opportunity arose to explore the application of resistance drilling to the estimation of softwood log quality through relating measurement data to log stiffness (MOE), an important indicator of resultant board properties post log processing. Resistance drilling (IML PD series power drills; RinnTech ResistographTM) allows the measurement of a standing tree with high resolution data describing average wood properties (primarily basic density) and their radial patterns of variation, taking only seconds to sample a tree.\nTo facilitate its commercial use, we developed a web-based processing platform (e.g https://forestquality.shinyapps.io/OpenAccess/) that allowed the drill data to be uploaded, processed and key metrics of growth (over and under bark diameters) and wood properties (basic density and stiffness) to be predicted. This platform allows thousands of traces to be uploaded and processed in a single upload. Data is processed and nothing is stored in the cloud, although the connection to online data bases could be enabled if there was commercial demand.\nAfter multiple studies developing sampling protocols [1] and establishing the accuracy, precision and robustness of the measures (e.g. [1–5]), resistance drilling is rapidly establishing itself as a routine commercial operation, contributing to the communication between growers and processors of logs regarding quality attributes based on density and stiffness.\nOur IP and software is being utilised by many softwood growers and sawmill processors across Australia, as well as companies in Indonesia, China, South Africa, Brazil and New Zealand.",

Others have also pursued the relationship between Resi data and wood stiffness (Sharapov et al. 2019). However it became obvious that, if commercial application of the technology was going to be cost-effective, the processing of the individual traces produced by the IML PD series drills, needed to be simple, fast and robust, requiring minimal or no user involvement.\nAt FQ we set about developing and testing a web platform application that would do all trace processing and data extraction that a commercial user would require and more.
