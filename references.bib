   abstract = {Use of the IML PD series Resi instrument is rapidly becoming a routine method among Australian forest growers for wood quality assessment. The major driver in the commercial uptake of the IML Resi is that, when data interpretation is facilitated by the web-based trace processing platforms, it is fast, cheap, and sufficiently precise for commercial use. 

The accuracy of a tool for wood density prediction based on drilling resistance might be affected by needle (drill) diameters or imperfections (e.g., uneven needle coating and varying tip size). Currently it is not known to what degree needle diameter or other geometric imperfections are an issue for quantifying wood density and stiffness. 

To quantify the effect of Resi needle diameter twelve new Resi needles were used with a single IML Resi PD 500 to obtain cross-sectional traces of a southern pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii x Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis) log. Standard settings for softwoods were employed (feed speed 200 cm/min and 3500 rpm). Diameter across the 12 needles ranged from 3.08 to 3.30 mm and each needle was tested 44 times. 

We found a significant difference in average drilling resistance (DR) which ranged from 31.7 to 34% among the needles. Maximum difference in DR between needles was 2.3% which would translate to 15.4 kg/m3 difference in predicted basic density. This difference occurred when needles with extreme diameters were tested, either very small (3.08 mm) or very large (3.21 - 3.30 mm). With one exception, there was no measurable difference in DR for needles in the typical 3.11- to 3.20-mm diameter range.},
