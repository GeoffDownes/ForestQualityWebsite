# Forest Quality Web Page


## About
This is a start at builidng a web site using RStudio, Quarto and github pages. 
Primarily the purpose is to build a more focussed site that the wix site at ForestQuality.com with a more up to date focus on current activites.

Eventually it will direct folk to the shiny server repo intended to be built at resiDrill.com.

It provides a focus for Resistance drilling, commonly called Resistograph which is a trademnark owned by Frank Rinn.
