## What do we do?

Forest Quality is a research and development company aimed at
facilitating the evaluation of wood quality and value in the standing
tree. Based in southern Tasmania, Australia, we provide the following
services

-   web-based processing of resistance drill traces taken using the IML
    PD series power drills

-   NIR analysis for the prediction of pulp yield and density in
    eucalypt samples

-   Analytical and reporting services of wood quality assessments

## Experience

After leaving CSIRO in 2012 Geoff Downes established FQ as a Research,
Development and Extension company with a view to develop and supply wood
quality assessment services to the forest industry. Through many years
of working with industry and involvement in non-destructive wood
property measurement (SilviScan, near infra red spectroscopy (NIR),
standing tree and log acoustics) the need was still there for an
assessment approach that was sufficiently low cost to allow broad-scale,
routine application in forest evaluation. Since its inception, FQ has
offered routine NIR analytical services, investing in the establishment
of a Bruker MPA instrument utlising well-tested calibrations for the
prediction of kraft pulk yield and cellulose content in plantation
eucalypts. Since then we have undertaken the evaluation of over 30
thousand wood meal samples for Australian eucalypt growers and this data
has provided an important input into the eucalypt breeding programmes of
our industry.

In 2015 the opportunity arose to explore the application of resistance
drilling to the estimation of softwood log quality through relating data
to log stiffness (MOE), an important indicator of resultant board
properties post processing. Resistance drilling (IML PD series power
drills) allows the measurement of a standing tree with high resolution
data describing average wood properties (primarily basic density) and
their radial patterns of variation, taking only seconds to sample a
tree. To facilitate its commercial use, we developed a web-based
processing platform using R shiny (e.g
<https://forestquality.shinyapps.io/OpenAccess/>) that allowed the drill
data to be uploaded, processed and key metrics of growth (over and under
bark diameters) and wood properties (basic density and stiffness) to be
predicted.

After multiple studies developing sampling protocols and establishing
the accuracy, precision and robustness of the measures, resistance
drilling is rapidly establishing itself as a routine commercial
operation, contributing to the communication between growers and
processors of logs regarding quality attributes based on density and
stiffness.

Our IP and software is being utilised by many softwood growers and
sawmill processors across Australia, as well as companies in Indonesia,
China, South Africa, Brazil and New Zealand.
